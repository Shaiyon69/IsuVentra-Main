# TODO: Fix Frontend Design - Shift to Green Outlines

## Approved Plan Steps
- [x] Update global CSS variables in App.vue to add outline-specific colors (e.g., --outline-accent) for better contrast and refinements.
- [x] Modify AdminDashboard.vue styles: Change sidebar buttons to use green outlines instead of solid backgrounds, adjust text colors for accessibility.
- [x] Modify AdminDashboard.vue styles: Update card styles to use subtle backgrounds and green outlines/borders.
- [x] Modify AdminDashboard.vue styles: Adjust table headers, buttons, and interactive elements to green outlines with hover fills.
- [x] Ensure hover effects provide green fill for feedback while maintaining outline base.
- [x] Test changes: Run frontend (npm run serve), verify interactions, contrast, and responsiveness. (Note: Browser tool disabled; manual testing recommended.)
- [ ] Extend changes to other views (e.g., LoginPage.vue, UserDashboard.vue) for consistency across the app.
- [x] Final review: Ensure minimalist green accent theme is achieved without overwhelming green fills.
